# Task 1 #

# Facility level data visualization and facility level association, 
# e.g., what is the relationship between mortality (SMR) and other quality
# measures and facility characteristics?



# Task 4 #

# Association study, e.g., what is the relationship between CKD and
# potential risk factors?


### Potential risk factors for GLM: ###

# Triglycerides (correlated with diabetes, obesity) ("Triglycerides")
# 4 factor levels: < 150 mg/dL (normal), 150-199 (borderline high), 200-499 (high),
# 500+ (very high)

# Total Cholesterol ("Total_chol")
# 4 factor levels: < 100 mg/dL (optimal), 100-129 (near/above optimal), 130-159
# (Borderline high), 160-189 mg/dL (high)

# Hypertension ("hypertension")
# 1=Unware, 2=Aware not treated, 3=Aware treated uncontrolled, 4=Aware treated controlled

# Age - we want to adjust for this



# Known correlated covariates, probably not worth investigating: 

# UACR/Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio, ("UACR")
# Higher = worse, correlated with higher stages of CKD

# eGFR - estimated glomerular filtration rate
"The" biomarker for CKD, so not useful to compare as covariate of CKD
# lower = worse, correlated with higher stages of CKD

### Methods: ###

# ANOVA?

# Try certain combinations of GLMs with measures that are not directly correlated
# compare AIC/BIC score between GLMs to avoid overfitting
# cross-validate between GLMs, try different link functions

# compare CKD rates between races/ethnicities and control for BMI, UACR, eGFR?

# Causal/counterfactual inference
